            <p>My name is Liza Herbert. I live in Toronto, Ontario where I'm studying Film and Television at Humber College.</p>

<p>I have training as an editor in Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, and Avid. I started editing in 2007 at the Centre for Arts and Technology in Halifax where I was lucky to have a great mentor.</p>
    
<p>I feel fortunate for having achieved my goals of learning the technical skills behind digital editing and making <a href="films.html">my first film.</a></p>

<p><b>My next goal is to work as an Assistant Director.</b> I'm looking to gain more experience in a professional environment. I am also available if your production house is looking for an Editor.</p>

        <p><b>Contact me if you have an opportunity to discuss.</b> LizaHerbert@hotmail.com</p>
